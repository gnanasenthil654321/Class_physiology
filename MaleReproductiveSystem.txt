As Gutyon says Physiology is a ever developing field, so it upto the user to be upto date with latest development.
THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM

1.The major functions of the male reproductive system
	- Spematogenesis
	- Performance of the male sexual act
	- regulation of the male reproductive functions by the various hormones

2.The physiological anatomy of the male sex organs
	- Testis is composed of Seminiferous tubules --> 900 in number --> each 1.5 m in length --> site of synthesis of sperms
	- The Epidymis --> another coiled structure --> 6 m in length.
	- The vas deferens
	- Ampulla of vas deferene
	- The prostratic urethra.
	- The Seminal vesicles empty their contents in the prostratic urethra.

3.The Spematogenesis:
	The diffrentiation of Spermatogonia to a mature sperm is called spermatogenesis.
	The gonadotrophic hormones play a role in initiating spermatogenesis right from age 13.

	Stages in spermatogenesis:
		- From birth to Puberty - migration of primordial germ cells into the gonads to form spermatogonia
		- The spematogonia proliferates inside the testis by mitosis.
		- Progressive modification - enlargment - formation of primary spermatocyte.
		- Each of the primary spermatocyte undergoes meisosis to form secondary spermatocytes.
		- Division of secondary spermatocytes by meiosis II --> formation of spermatids
		- Maturation of spermatids -- > spermatozoa.
	
	The entire process of formation of mature spermatozoa from spermatogonia is around 74 days.

4.Sturucture of the sperm:
	- Head
		- consists of condensed nucleus
		- Acrosome
			- contains enzymes similar to the ones in a lysosomes of a regular cell 
				- hyaluronidase       |
				- Proteolytic enzymes | help in fertilization.

	- Tail (flagellum)
		- central skeleton, constructed of 11 microtubules --> the axoneme
		- a thin membrane covering the axoneme
		- collection of mitochondria surrounding the axoneme in the proximal portion of the tail.
 The back and forth movement of the tail aids in the longitudinal motion of the sperm.
 The normal velocity of sperm in a fluid medium -> 1 to 4 mm/min.
	
	The role of hormones in spermatogensis:
		- Testosteone - secreted from the leydig cells - growth and division of testicular germinal cells.
		- Luteinizing hormone - secreted from the anterior pitutary - stimulates the leydig cells to produce testosterone.
		- FSH - secreted from the anterior pitutary - sitmulates the sertoli cells( conversion of spermatids to sperms)
		- Estrogens - conversion of testosterone to estrogen is donein the sertoli cells, when they are stimulated by the FSH -essential for spermatogenesis.
		- Growth hormone - secreted by the anterior pitutary - takes care of the background metabolic function of the testes and promotes early division of spermatogonia.

5. Maturation of sperm takes place in the epdidymis 
	- sperms taken from the seminiferous tubules shows no capablity to fertilize a ovum but the sperms taken from the epdidymis after a storage time (18 - 24 hrs), they show capablity to fertilize a ovum.

6. Storage area of sperm:
	- the epdidymis and the vas defrens are areas where the sperms are stored. The sperms are kept in a highly inactive state by the secretions from the vas and epdidymis.
	- maturation - only on ejaculation the sperms become motile and attain the capablity to fertilize the ovum - this process is called maturation - certain substances are ejaculated along with the sperm that are secreted by the sertoli cells and the epithelium of the epdidymis that help in maturation of the sperm.

7. Role of the prostrate gland.
	- the sperms require a slightly alkaline pH to become fertile.
	- the vaginal secretions and the secretion of teh vas deferens are both acidic and hence the hinder the sperms ability to fertilize.
	- the secretions of the prostrate are alkaline and aid in bringing about the alkaline pH.
	- during ejaculation, the prostratic capsule also contracts along with the contractions of the vas defrence to add bulk to the ejaculated fluid.

8. Semen
	- composition
	- sperm - 10%
	- Prostratic secretion - 30% (gives the milky color to the semen)
	- Seminal vescicle secretion - 60% (bulk of semen)
	- avg pH - 7.5
	- an enzyme that causes conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin (formation of a coagulam containing the sperm in the cercix) - this coagulum dissolves as time progresses and slowly the sperms start to become motile
	- the lifetime of sperms inside the female reproductive tract is around 24 - 48 hrs.

9. Sperm Capacitation:
	- The sperm is held inactive by the secretions the genital duct epithelia.
	- While inside the male reproductive tract the sperm  is exposed to cholestrol vesicles, which deposit over the acrosome cap and thereby making it thicker.
	- Once ejaculated, the female reproductive tract fluid wash away these inhibitory factors, causing activation of the sperm.
	- After ejaculation, the sperms are less exposed to the cholestrol vesciles and hence the acrosome cap also become weak.
	- After ejaculation the membrane of the sperm also becomes more permeable to calcium ions . In the tail, this increased permeablity cause motiltiy of the sperm and in the acrosome breaks away to release its enzymatic contents.

10. Acrosome reaction:
	- the release of the acrosomal contents to digest the zona pellicuda layer of the ovum to fertilize it is called acrosome reaction.

11. Abnormal spermatogenesis
	- Incresed temperature.
	- Cryptorchidism (undescended testis)
	- Abnormal sperm morphology
	- Low sperm count ( sperm count < 20 million / mm3 is considered to insufficient to fertilize a ovum)

12. Male sexual act
	- Stimuli
		- Tactile stimulation of the penis
		- Skin around the genitals
		- Filling the reproductive tract with secretions
		- Thoughts
	These stimuli are carried via the pudendal nerve and are integrated in the sacral and lumbar spinal cords.

	- Stages of the male sexual act.
		- Penile erection
		  Parasymthetic stimuation -> cause relaxation of arteries in the penis -> filling of blood in cavernous sinuses -> obstruction of venous outflow
		- Lubrication
		  Parasympathetic function -> secretion of the urethral glands and bulbourethral glands exits the urethra to lubricate. ( the major lubrication during coitus is provided by the female reproductive tract).

		- Emmission and ejaculation
		  Sympathetic stimulation --> when the stimulus becomes intensely high, the reflex centers emit sympthathetic impulses (T12 - L2 sections of the cord) via hypogastric and pelvic sympathetic nerve to cause emmision.

		  Emmission-> arrival of sperm, prostratic secretion and the seminal secretions into the internal urethra is called emmission.
		  Ejaculation-> fullness of the internal urethra sends affrent signals via the pudental nerve to the sacral regions of the cord. These sensory signals further excite rhythical contraction of the internal genital organs and the muscles of the penis (the ischiocavernous and bulbocavernous)causing ejaculation of contents from the urethra to the exterior.

		 During ejaculation muslces of the trunk and the pelvis also goes in for contraction. This entire process of emmision and ejaculation constitutes the male orgasm.

		- Resolution:
		  Disappearence of the sexual excitement after the male orgasm. The erection disappears within 1 to 2 minutes.

13. The male sex hormones
	- the following hormones have masculanizing effects and hence are called androgens, the following androgens are seen in an male
	- Testosterone (secreted from the interstitial cells of leydig)
	- Dihydrotestosterone ( peripheral conversion of testosterone)
	- Androstenedione


14. Fucntions of testosterone:
	- Development of a male fetus
	  During the fetal life, the testosterone secreted by the genital ridges cause the developement of the male genital organs.
	- Decend of the testis
	- Development of the primary and secondary sexual chareceristics
		- Effect on the distribution of body hair
		  hair over the pubis, linea alba, on the face, chest and sometimes the back.

		- Baldness.
		- Development of the masculine voice
		  Hypertrophy of the laryngeal mucosa and enlargement of the larynx.
		- Increased thickness of skin and increased sebaceous secretion.
		- Increased muscle mass and deposition of protein in other areas (skin)
		- Increased bone mass and calcium retention. - Development of funnel shaped pelvis (narrow pelvic outlet, increased length of pelvis  as opposed to the female pelvis which is ovoid) - fusion of epiphyses.
		- Increased Basal metabolic rate.
		- Increase in RBC count as a consequence to increaed BMR.
		- Increase in total body water.
